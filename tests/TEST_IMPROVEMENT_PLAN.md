# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Current code coverage: 62%
- Many critical components have good test coverage
- Key areas like file encoding, file I/O, and content extraction now have improved test coverage

## Areas Needing Better Coverage

### 1. Command Execution (High Priority)
- The command execution functions in `code_assistant.py` need more robust testing
- Test both standard command execution and error handling
- Create tests for both safe and potentially unsafe commands
- Test working directory handling

### 2. Web Search Functionality (Medium Priority)
- Tests for web search content extraction
- Mock the external API calls
- Test error handling and timeout scenarios

### 3. File Operation Error Cases (Medium Priority)
- More test cases for file operations under error conditions
- Permission errors, disk full errors
- Test binary file handling
- Test large file handling

### 4. Planning Functionality (High Priority)
- Test plan generation functions
- Test prompt formatting 
- Test the handling of various types of planning requests

### 5. Interactive CLI Features (Low Priority)
- Test the interactive features of the CLI
- Test user input handling
- Test the display of results

## Testing Strategy

### Improved Mocking
- Create more comprehensive mock fixtures for external dependencies like Ollama API
- Create mock file system fixtures for testing file operations without real files
- Mock HTTP responses for web search functions

### Test Organization
- Organize tests by functionality rather than by source file
- Group related tests together for better maintainability
- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently

### Edge Cases
- Test handling of very large inputs
- Test Unicode and special character handling
- Test resource exhaustion scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Functionality (Immediate)
- Focus on improving test coverage for:
  - Command execution
  - Planning functionality
  - File operations error handling

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality (Next)
- Add tests for:
  - Web search
  - Complex file operations
  - Model switching

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Full Coverage (Future)
- Focus on achieving 90%+ coverage
- Test all edge cases
- Test interactive features

## Recommended Test Files to Create

1. `tests/test_command_execution_extended.py`: Comprehensive tests for command execution
2. `tests/test_web_search_extended.py`: Tests for web search functionality
3. `tests/test_file_operations_errors.py`: Tests for error handling in file operations
4. `tests/test_planning_functionality_extended.py`: More tests for planning functionality

## Maintenance Notes

- As new features are added, corresponding tests should be created immediately
- Whenever a bug is fixed, a regression test should be added
- Regular coverage reports should be generated to identify gaps
