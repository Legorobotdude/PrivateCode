# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Current code coverage: 78% (improved from 75%)
- Made significant improvements in file operations, command execution, planning functionality, web search functionality, handling of edge cases, and model switching
- Added 100+ new test cases across the codebase

## Completed Improvements
- **Command Execution**: Added tests for safety mechanisms, command parsing, and special handlers
- **File Operations**: Added tests for encoding detection, line range reading, and error handling
- **Planning Functionality**: Added tests for plan generation, JSON extraction, and step execution
- **Web Search Functionality**: Added extensive tests for content extraction, mocking external APIs, error handling, and result processing
- **File Operation Edge Cases**: Added comprehensive tests for permissions, binary files, encodings, large files, and I/O errors
- **Encoding Detection**: Enhanced UTF-32 encoding detection logic and added tests
- **Model Switching**: Expanded tests for model selection, unavailable models, error handling, and proposed fallback mechanisms

## Areas Needing Further Coverage

### 1. ✅ Web Search Functionality (High Priority) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added tests for web search content extraction
- ✅ Implemented mocking of external API calls
- ✅ Added tests for error handling and timeout scenarios
- ✅ Created tests for search result processing and formatting
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_web_search_extended.py` with 10 additional test cases

### 2. ✅ File Operation Edge Cases (Medium Priority) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added tests for permission errors and access control
- ✅ Added tests for behavior with extremely large files
- ✅ Added tests for handling of binary files and unusual encodings
- ✅ Added tests for disk full scenarios and other I/O errors
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_file_operations_edge_cases.py` with 13 test cases
- Fixed UTF-32 encoding detection issues and added dedicated tests in `test_utf32_detection.py`

### 3. ✅ Model Switching (Medium Priority) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added tests for model selection logic
- ✅ Added tests for handling of unavailable models
- ✅ Added tests for error handling with different models
- ✅ Added proposals for model fallback functionality
- Expanded `test_model_switching.py` with 7 additional test cases
- Created new `test_model_fallback.py` with proposed enhancements for fallback behavior

### 4. Interactive CLI Features (Low Priority)
- Test the interactive features of the CLI
- Test user input handling and validation
- Test display formatting and color handling
- Test terminal size adaptations

## Testing Strategy

### Improved Mocking
- Create reusable mock fixtures for external dependencies
- Use filesystem virtualization where appropriate
- Mock HTTP responses with realistic test data

### Test Organization
- Continue organizing tests by functionality
- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently
- Employ property-based testing for complex inputs

### Edge Cases
- Test handling of very large inputs
- Test Unicode and special character handling
- Test resource exhaustion scenarios
- Test concurrency and timeout handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Web Search Testing (COMPLETED ✅)
- Created `tests/test_web_search_extended.py`
- Implemented mocking of external search API responses
- Added tests for search query parsing and extraction
- Added tests for result processing and integration
- Achieved comprehensive coverage of web search functionality

### Phase 2: Edge Cases and Error Handling (COMPLETED ✅)
- Created `tests/test_file_operations_edge_cases.py` to test file operation edge cases
- Created `tests/test_utf32_detection.py` to test UTF-32 encoding detection
- Improved encoding detection algorithm for UTF-32 and other formats
- Implemented tests for resource limitations and error conditions
- Added tests for exceptional inputs and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Model Switching and CLI Features (IN PROGRESS ⚙️)
- ✅ Enhanced model switching tests in `tests/test_model_switching.py`
- ✅ Created `tests/test_model_fallback.py` for proposed fallback functionality
- Focus on interactive CLI features (next)
- Test terminal rendering and display
- Work toward 80%+ coverage target

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Run coverage reports after significant code changes
- Add regression tests for any bugs discovered
- Continuously refine tests as the codebase evolves
- Prioritize testing for frequently changing components
