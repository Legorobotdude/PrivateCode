# Test Improvement Plan: Next Steps

## Phase 2: Edge Cases and Error Handling

Based on the test improvement plan, the next phase focuses on testing edge cases and error handling with a priority on file operation edge cases. This document outlines the specific tests to implement next.

### File Operation Edge Cases

#### 1. Permission Errors and Access Control
- Create tests for reading files with insufficient permissions
- Test writing to read-only files
- Test accessing files with different user/group permissions
- Test handling of locked files

#### 2. Extremely Large Files
- Test reading very large files (100MB+)
- Test file size limits and truncation behavior
- Test memory usage during large file operations
- Test performance degradation with large files

#### 3. Binary Files and Unusual Encodings
- Test handling of binary file content
- Test various file encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, Latin-1, etc.)
- Test files with mixed encodings
- Test files with invalid encoding declarations
- Test handling of BOM (Byte Order Mark) in different encodings

#### 4. Disk Full Scenarios and I/O Errors
- Test behavior when disk is full during write operations
- Test handling of network drive disconnection during file operations
- Test behavior during corrupted file access
- Test recovery mechanisms after I/O errors

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create a new test file `tests/test_file_operations_edge_cases.py`
2. Use temporary files and directories with specific permissions and content
3. Mock file system behavior for extreme cases (disk full, etc.)
4. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple encodings efficiently
5. Add tests for recovery mechanisms and proper error reporting

### Testing Tools and Approaches

- Use `pytest` fixtures for setting up test environments
- Use `io` and `StringIO`/`BytesIO` for simulating files without actual disk operations
- Use mocking to simulate disk full scenarios
- Create test files with various encodings and sizes

## Timeline

1. Implement permission and access control tests (2-3 days)
2. Implement large file handling tests (2-3 days)
3. Implement binary and encoding tests (1-2 days)
4. Implement disk full and I/O error tests (2-3 days)
5. Review and refine tests (1-2 days)

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved handling of edge cases in file operations
- Better error messages and recovery mechanisms
- More robust code for handling unusual file types and errors
- Increased test coverage for file operations from current level to 85%+
