# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Current code coverage: 65% (improved from 60%)
- Made significant improvements in file operations, command execution, and planning functionality
- Added 55+ new test cases across the codebase

## Completed Improvements
- **Command Execution**: Added tests for safety mechanisms, command parsing, and special handlers
- **File Operations**: Added tests for encoding detection, line range reading, and error handling
- **Planning Functionality**: Added tests for plan generation, JSON extraction, and step execution

## Areas Needing Further Coverage

### 1. Web Search Functionality (High Priority)
- Tests for web search content extraction
- Mock the external API calls
- Test error handling and timeout scenarios
- Test search result processing and formatting

### 2. File Operation Edge Cases (Medium Priority)
- Test permission errors and access control
- Test behavior with extremely large files
- Test handling of binary files and unusual encodings
- Test disk full scenarios and other I/O errors

### 3. Model Switching (Medium Priority)
- Test model selection logic
- Test handling of unavailable models
- Test performance with different models
- Test model-specific parameter handling

### 4. Interactive CLI Features (Low Priority)
- Test the interactive features of the CLI
- Test user input handling and validation
- Test display formatting and color handling
- Test terminal size adaptations

## Testing Strategy

### Improved Mocking
- Create reusable mock fixtures for external dependencies
- Use filesystem virtualization where appropriate
- Mock HTTP responses with realistic test data

### Test Organization
- Continue organizing tests by functionality
- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently
- Employ property-based testing for complex inputs

### Edge Cases
- Test handling of very large inputs
- Test Unicode and special character handling
- Test resource exhaustion scenarios
- Test concurrency and timeout handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Web Search Testing (Next)
- Create `tests/test_web_search_extended.py`
- Mock external search API responses
- Test search query parsing and extraction
- Test result processing and integration

### Phase 2: Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Focus on less common but critical error paths
- Test resource limitations (memory, disk space)
- Test exceptional inputs and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Full Coverage and Optimization
- Work toward 80%+ coverage target
- Focus on previously untested code paths
- Refine test suite for speed and maintainability

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Run coverage reports after significant code changes
- Add regression tests for any bugs discovered
- Continuously refine tests as the codebase evolves
- Prioritize testing for frequently changing components
